# Image-Based Deep Learning for Early Detection of Adolescent Emotional and Self-Harm Risks

## Overview

Early detection of emotional disorders and self-harm risks among adolescents is a critical and growing challenge in mental health care. Traditional assessment methods, such as self-reported questionnaires and manual clinical interviews, often suffer from limitations including subjective biases, delayed detection, and poor scalability. These limitations make it difficult to meet the urgent demand for proactive and large-scale intervention solutions.

This project presents a novel image-based deep learning framework designed for the early identification of emotional and self-harm risks in adolescents. By leveraging multimodal clinical data and a structured deep learning architecture, the framework offers an interpretable, robust, and scalable solution for adolescent mental health intervention.

## Methodology

The proposed framework consists of two main components:

- **MedForm**: A multimodal diagnostic module that captures clinical image features and patterns using hierarchical attention mechanisms and robust feature fusion.
- **DiagSolve**: A decision-making module that addresses uncertainty-aware and context-sensitive classification, enhancing interpretability and decision confidence.

The model emphasizes:

- High sensitivity and specificity under real-world clinical settings.
- Interpretability and resilience against noise in clinical input data.
- Scalability for broad implementation in adolescent health services.

## Contributions

- Introduces a systematic medical AI strategy for mental health risk identification.
- Enhances early diagnostic precision with minimal dependency on subjective input.
- Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets compared to conventional methods.
- Aligns with real-world clinical needs through robust evaluation in practical scenarios.
